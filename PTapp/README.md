# Private Trainer App School project

This project is for creating an app for a Private Trainer company, that will show customers and trainings in a list. The company will also be able to add and edit customers, delete existing customers and add training to a customer or delete a training.

In the future, it will also enable exporting all customers to a CSV file without extra data.

The plan is to add a calendar for the personal trainer to see all trainings monthly, weekly or daily.

If possible, the app will be deployed to some cloud server.

Lastly, the plan is to show statistics in a bar chart about the amount of different activities.
